# Fast Walk
This set of tracks is a fast walk.

Track 00 is in wet sand

If you would like to take a look at the mesh in blender, the track.blend file can be downloaded from:

For some purposes it may be easier to work with the model without the sand texture applied. For example, if you want to apply a shader based on elevation, having no texture is easier.

Unfortunately I could not upload the textured file to Github. I can upload a decimated file, if I decimated the model by a factor of 8, so that it is smaller than the 25 MB limit but it show unacceptable deteriation in the quality of the model. Sorry. <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrackerLounge/DigitalTrackingPit/master/FastWalk/tracks02_textured_decimated_by_8.zip">Download FILE - tracks02_textured_decimated_by_8.zip</a>

Note: I had to apply a decimator modifier of type planer by a factor of 20 to reduce the number of verticies from ~1.3 million to ~500,000 and then zip compress it to get the file small enough for GitHub to allow me to upload it. The model looks pretty similar to original model.
