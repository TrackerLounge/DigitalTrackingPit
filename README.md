# Digital Tracking Pit
A collection of tracks (foot prints) 3D models depicting common walking patterns and pressure releases. These files can be viewed in Blender3d, a free tool available at <a href="https://www.blender.org/">blender.org</a>

For details on the types of sand in each box see:

# Slow Walk
This set of tracks is a slow walk.

Note: I had to apply a decimator modifier of type planer by a factor of 20 to reduce the number of verticies from ~1.3 million to ~500,000 and then zip compress it to get the file small enough for GitHub to allow me to upload it. The model looks pretty similar to original model.
