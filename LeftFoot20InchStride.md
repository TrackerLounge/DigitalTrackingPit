If you would like to take a look at the mesh in blender, the track.blend file can be downloaded from:

Note: I had to decimate the number of verticies by a factor of 5 to get the model small enough to upload to GitHub.

For some purposes it may be easier to work with the model without the sand texture applied. For example, if you want to apply a shader based on elevation, having no texture is easier.
